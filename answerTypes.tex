\section{Basic Answer Type}

The following code produces a basic answer. In print, this displays the correct answer in an answer box. Online, this displays a blank space for the student to fill in the answer. 

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{question}
$3\times 2 = \answer{6}$
\end{question}
\end{verbatim}

Produces:

\begin{question}
$3\times 2 = \answer{6}$
\end{question}

In addition to numerical answers, we also support elementary functions.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{question}
  $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} x^2\sin(y) = \answer{2xsin(y)}$
\end{question}
\end{verbatim}

Produces:

\begin{question}
  $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} x^2\sin(y) = \answer{2xsin(y)}$
\end{question}

\begin{remark}
Under the hood, Ximera is parsing the user input, producing a
function, and checking the user input function against ``answer'' at
$100$ different complex numbers, and seeing if the results are
``reasonably'' close to each other.  We compare the complex extensions
of these functions to circumvent domain issues.
\end{remark}

If you would like to allow more tolerance, you can use the \verb!tolerance! option. 

\begin{warning}
Setting the tolerance to 0 will force exact comparison of floating-point numbers, which will likely cause unexpected problems. This is strongly discouraged. 
\end{warning}

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{question}
  Write a number that is within 0.01 of 8: \answer{8}
\end{question}
\begin{question}
  Write a number that is within 5 of 8: \answer[tolerance=5]{8}
\end{question}
\end{verbatim}

Produces:

\begin{question}
  Write a number that is within 0.01 of 8: $\answer{8}$
\end{question}
\begin{question}
  Write a number that is within 5 of 8: $\answer{8}$  \emph{broken as of 7/28/2015:} the ximera class file does not know about tolerance yet.
\end{question}

We also support matrices of expressions in answers.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{question}
Enter the matrix  \(\begin{bmatrix} x & y \\ xy & z+1 \end{bmatrix}\)
    \begin{matrixAnswer}
	    correctMatrix = [['x','y'],['xy','z+1']]
    \end{matrixAnswer}
\end{question}
\end{verbatim}

\emph{broken as of 7/28/2015:} This should eventually convert to a +/- matrix answer widget.

\begin{question}
Enter the matrix  \(\begin{bmatrix} x & y \\ xy & z+1 \end{bmatrix}\)
\begin{matrixAnswer}
    correctMatrix = [['x','y'],['xy','z+1']]
\end{matrixAnswer}
\end{question}

\begin{remark}
  The plus and minus buttons add and subtract columns or rows.  
\end{remark}


\section{Multiple Choice Answer Type}

Multiple-choice questions need one or more of their answers to be labeled as correct. By default, the options always appear in the same order.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{question}
Which of the following functions has a graph which is a parabola?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{$y=x^2+3x-3$}
    \choice{$y = \frac{1}{x+2}$}
    \choice{$y=3x+1$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}
\end{verbatim}

Produces:

\begin{question}
  Which of the following functions has a graph which is a parabola?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{$y=x^2+3x-3$}
    \choice{$y = \frac{1}{x+2}$}
    \choice{$y=3x+1$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}


If you would like the multiple-choice question to occur in-line instead of taking up space, you can use the inline command \verb!wordChoice!.
 
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{question}
  When comparing the functions $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = 2^x$, \wordChoice{\choice{$f(x)$} \choice[correct]{$g(x)$}} grows more quickly for large $x$.
\end{question}
\end{verbatim}

Produces:

\begin{question}
  When comparing the functions $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = 2^x$, \wordChoice{\choice{$f(x)$} \choice[correct]{$g(x)$}} grows more quickly for large $x$.
  \emph{broken as of 7/28/2015:} the web does not understand wordChoice yet at all.
\end{question}

\section{Free-Response Answer Type}

The free response environment gives students access to a \LaTeX\ editor. 

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{question}
  Tell us a little about yourself!
  \begin{freeResponse}
      My name is Professor X. I am 42 years old, originally from Columbus, OH. The most recent 
      math I learned was functional analysis, three years ago. My favorite ice cream is Superman. 
      My favorite function is $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$.
  \end{freeResponse}
\end{question}
\end{verbatim}

Produces:

\begin{question}
  Tell us a little about yourself!
  \begin{freeResponse}
      My name is Professor X. I am 42 years old, originally from Columbus, OH. The most recent 
      math I learned was functional analysis, three years ago. My favorite ice cream is Superman. 
      My favorite function is $f(x) = e^{-x^2}.$
  \end{freeResponse}
\end{question}

\begin{remark}
Clicking on \verb!View model solution! shows the user
whatever you typed in the  \verb!freeResponse! environment.
\end{remark}


\section{Code}

If you are displaying computer code to the student, you can use the \verb!code! or \verb!python! environments.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{code}
This is in code environment.
    This is indented on the second line.

This is on the fourth line.
\end{code}
\end{verbatim}

Produces:

\begin{code}
This is in code environment.
    This is indented on the second line.

This is on the fourth line.
\end{code}

If you are asking your students to write python code, for example trying to get them to type \verb!|return x**2!, you can use the \verb!python! environment and some validation functions.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{question}
Model the function $f(x) = x^2$ as a python function. Try using \verb|return x**2|
\begin{python}
  def f(x):
  return #your code here

  def validator():
  return (f(4) == 16) and (f(-5) == 25)
\end{python}
\end{question}
\end{verbatim}

Produces:

\begin{question}
Model the function $f(x) = x^2$ as a python function. Try using \verb|return x**2|
\begin{python}
  def f(x):
  return #your code here

  def validator():
  return (f(4) == 16) and (f(-5) == 25)
\end{python}
\end{question}

\youtube{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ} %doesn't work in html
