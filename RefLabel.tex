\title{References and Labels}

This is some text above the theorems to see if the page scrolls.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:theoremA} This is the first theorem on the page?
\end{theorem}

hmm

\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of B]
\label{thm:theoremB} This is the second theorem on the page.
\end{theorem}

hm

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:theoremC} This is the third theorem on the page.
\end{theorem}

hm


\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:theoremD} This is the fourth theorem on the page.
\end{theorem}

As we saw from \hyperref[thm:theoremA]{The First Theorem}, \hyperref[thm:theoremB]{The Second Theorem}, \hyperref[thm:theoremC]{The Third Theorem}, and \hyperref[thm:theoremD]{The Fourth Theorem}, this document has theorems, and refers to them appropriately!

Of course, automatic references like this one to \autoref{thm:theoremA} fail miserably.
